                            Karelian language corpus include three varieties which can be considered 
                            as dialects or separate languages: Karelian Proper,

                        <p>The corpus is a search information system, including a set of texts 
                        written in some language in a digital form. 
                        The corpus is a more than a simple set of texts, 
                        the corpus should provide a search possibilities within these texts and the possibility 
                        to add (bind) some information to these texts. 
                        A search possibilities of the corpus are based on the electronic dictionary (as part of the corpus) 
                        connected with the texts of the corpus.</p>
