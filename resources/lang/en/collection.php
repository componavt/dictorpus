    'about' => [1 =>'Ritual lamentations are considered to be one of the most ancient genres of Veps song folklore, as well as one of the most developed types of oral 
        poetic tradition. Within the genre, three local traditions can be distinguished: Northern Veps, Central Veps and Southern Veps. In the past, 
        being an integral part of the rituals of the family cycle, lamentations accompanied the main stages of the wedding and funeral rites. The text of the ceremonial 
        lamentation is created using traditional formulas and expressive means specific for the Veps language.
